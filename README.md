A personal project of writing a raytracer in CUDA.

After having read through the amazing [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series, and also after having studied a little bit of CUDA, I decided to try porting the raytracer to work on the GPU.

So far, I've implemented the first part of the book series. This is still a work in progress for me
